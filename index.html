    <h1>Say Something</h1>
    <h2>Justin Timberlake  ft. Chris Stapleton</h2>

    <p>
        Everyone knows all about my direction <br>
        And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there <br>
        But still I don't go there  
    </p>
    <p>
        Everybody says "say something" <br>
        Say something, say something <br>
        Say something, say something <br>
        Let's say something... <br>
        I don't wanna get ..caught up in the rhythm of it <br>
        But I can't help myself <br>
        No I can't help myself, no, no <br>
        Caught up in the middle of it <br>
        No I can't help myself <br>
        No I can't help myself, no, no, no <br>
        Caught up in the rhythm of 
    </p>
    <p>
        Everyone knows all about my transgressions  <br>
        Still in my heart somewhere there's melody and harmony <br>
        For you and me, tonight (whoa) <br>
        I hear them call my name
    </p>
